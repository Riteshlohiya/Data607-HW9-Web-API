Assignment - Web APIs

The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs
You'll need to start by signing up for an API key.
Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it to an R dataframe.

Load Libraries:

#install.packages("rjson")

```{r}
library(httr)
library(rjson)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
```

Load Books API:

```{r}
books <- GET("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/best-sellers/history.json", 
                         query = list(api_key = "8a79e79ab80a4363b99376b942f5c0a7"))  
names(books)
books$status_code
```

Transform into Data Frame:

```{r}
booksdf <- fromJSON(books$url) %>% as.data.frame()
booksdf
```
